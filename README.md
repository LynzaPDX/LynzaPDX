- 👋 Hi, I’m @LynzaPDX!
- 👀 I’m interested in docs as code and using a CLI to write docs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Git, especially rebase and similar tasks. I'm also very interested in working with Sphinx and reStructuredText, along with Markdown.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helping to edit, proof, or tighten up written English docs.
- 📫 How to reach me -- reach out here.
